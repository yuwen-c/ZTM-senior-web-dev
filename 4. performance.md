## Honey I shrunk the files - reduce file size

### HTML, CSS, JS
- use uglify to minimize the files
### tools for reduce image size - change format or lower quality
- reduce PNG with TinyPNG
- reduce JPG with JPEG-optimizer
- lower JPEG image quality(30-60%) (save to another file with lower quality)

### other solutions - the larger the resolution, the larger the file size -- keep them small
- if your css says this picture has width of 500px, then chop it down to the size you need, don't keep it as 1500px.

### use media query to serve the proper size for the screen
- check the network of browser

### use CDNs like imgix
