# what is SSH about?
- An internet protocol, for communication between 2 devices.

## some protocols we've seen
- HTTP: for internet, sending HTML, CSS, JS file from server to browsers
- HTTPS: like HTTP, but is encrypted.
- FTP: file transfer protocol? used to upload and download files


## SSH, secure shell protocol
- is not limited between server and browsers
- is encrypted
- used to transfer files between 2 computers through internet
- can controll the remote computer via command line
- Shell: something we can use to communicate with operation system


## a remote server
- create it with low rate on digital ocean
- get your server name

### connect to it with SSH commands
```
$ SSH {User}@{Host}
```
```
$ SSH root@167.99.146.XX
//    admin, address
```

# senarios - saving the day
## your project was deleted from the server by mistake, please re-deploy it
- connect to the server
```
$ SSH root@167.99.146.XX
```
- go to our githun repo and clone it to remote server...here we need the ```git``` command. so install it
```
$ sudo api-get install git
// apt-get is just like npm, but in ubunto
```
- git clone
```
$ git clone git@github.com.....(SSH)
// but if you don't have the public key set, then it fails
// in this case, use http clon
```
- run this project, but install packages before.
```
$ npm install
```
- if you don't have npm installed, then install ```node.js```
```
$ sudo api-get install nodejs
```
- leave remote server
```
$ exit
```

## instead, clone a repo from local to remote server
- use recursive command

# 3 encryption techniques involve in SSH

## symmetrical encryption
- two parties hold the same key, for both encryption and decryption.
- how the two parties get the same key safely? - key exchange algorithm
- key exchange algorighem is take some pieces of data and two parties generate the same key. (so the key doesn't exange actually)

## asymmetrical encryption - key exchange algorithm - 用來產生symmetical key 
- previous ISSUE: how the two parties get the same key safely?
- [interesting experiment with colored water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI)
- Alice and Bob, send to each other: (g^a) and (g^b). (g is global, but you cannot get a or b by knowing g.) 
- Alice gets (g^b) and Bob gets (g^a), then add theirs' own key a, b, produce (g^ab) => two parties hold the same key.
- so called: Diffie Helman key exchange.
- they use some shared data and some private data to generate symmetrical key in each device, without letting the key exposed.


//
- before the two parties hold their keys, a key exchange happens first, this is an asymmetrical encryption
- Two parties exchange their Public keys, and hold Private key by them selves.
- an message is encrypted by the Public key of Alicia, and sent to Bob, then decrypted by Private key of Bob.
- it only happens in the opening section before symmetrical encryption.
- with a misterious method, by gathering the public keys of both side and it's private key, the 2 parties can generate each symmerical keys, without sending it to public. 


## RSA - another system of encryption
- each party holds private key and public key
- use Bob's public key to encrypt your message that sending to Bob, then Bob can decrypt it with his private key


## interception - 攔截，man in the middle，中間人 - certificate
- sean, pretends he's the one you want to connect with and get secure connection with you.
- both RSA and Diffie Helman CANNOT stop interception, the man in the middle
- only the certificate of website in the real world can stop this.
[from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsXMMT2CqqE)
> SSL is what websites (HTTPS) are using to implement the whole chain of security features to finally become secure against man in the middle attacks. The final step that SSL does ontop of RSA key exchange is to verify the public key with the certificate that server sent to the client upon SSL negotiation, using a global certificate store. In short, certificates themself have to be signed by a certificate authority, which (typically) can only be modified by Windows Updates (for Windows) and alike.

> The certificates for HTTPS include the domain name in it's ServerName property to restrict the usage of the certificate to a particular website. The browser will make sure to verify this.

> I think this should have been mentioned in the video before people run off and use RSA by itself when it really isn't secure against man in the middle (but it is secure against capturing of the data where it is not re-encrypted).
Side note, SSL includes all above mentioned features (configurable). If you're interested in playing around with this in programming, try out the OpenSSL library.
Also HTTPS is typically using an SSL library such as OpenSSL. For example, Chrome uses "boringssl" which is a library 'forked' from (based on) OpenSSL.


## hashing - if the message I received has been modified?
- to check if the message has been modify
- a hash function can hash the symmetrical key + message content, to a hash number
- send this outside of the SSH area
- when the other computer receives, generate a hash with the content and key, and see if these two match.


# conslusion
- key exchange algorithm happens first, Diffie Helman
- produce symmetrical key
- Use RSA to check authentication: server send a test with client's public key, if the client can decrypt it with private key, => OK
- SSH connection begins
