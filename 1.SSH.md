# what is SSH about?
- An internet protocol, for communication between 2 devices.

## some protocols we've seen
- HTTP: for internet, sending HTML, CSS, JS file from server to browsers
- HTTPS: like HTTP, but is encrypted.
- FTP: file transfer protocol? used to upload and download files


## SSH, secure shell protocol
- is not limited between server and browsers
- is encrypted
- used to transfer files between 2 computers through internet
- can controll the remote computer via command line
- Shell: something we can use to communicate with operation system


## a remote server
- create it with low rate on digital ocean
- get your server name

### connect to it with SSH commands
```
$ SSH {User}@{Host}
```
```
$ SSH root@167.99.146.XX
//    admin, address
```

# senarios - saving the day
## your project was deleted from the server by mistake, please re-deploy it
- connect to the server
```
$ SSH root@167.99.146.XX
```
- go to our githun repo and clone it to remote server...here we need the ```git``` command. so install it
```
$ sudo api-get install git
// apt-get is just like npm, but in ubunto
```
- git clone
```
$ git clone git@github.com.....(SSH)
// but if you don't have the public key set, then it fails
// in this case, use http clon
```
- run this project, but install packages before.
```
$ npm install
```
- if you don't have npm installed, then install ```node.js```
```
$ sudo api-get install nodejs
```
- leave remote server
```
$ exit
```

## instead, clone a repo from local to remote server
- use recursive command

# 3 encryption techniques involve in SSH
## symmetrical encryption
- two parties hold the same key, for both encryption and decryption.
- how to exchange key safely? - key exchange algorithm

## asymmetrical encryption - key exchange algorithm
- before the two parties hold their keys, a key exchange happens first, this is an asymmetrical encryption
- Two parties exchange their Public keys, and hold Private key by them selves.
- an message is encrypted by the Public key of Alicia, and sent to Bob, then decrypted by Private key of Bob.
- it only happens in the opening section before symmetrical encryption.
- with a misterious method, by gathering the public keys of both side and it's private key, the 2 parties can generate each symmerical keys, without sending it to public.
