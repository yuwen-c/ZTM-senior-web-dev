# follow instruction of gitlab
- keygen with your gitlab account email
- enter file name of key pairs
  
## add key to ssh-agent
```
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 6366
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab
Identity added: /Users/.../.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab (yuwen.chiu@....com)
```

## set ```config file``` if a non-default file path used
- touch one
```
$ touch ~/.ssh/config
```
- edit
```
$ open ~/.ssh/config
```
- follow the example setting, I choose the private server one.

### NOTE: 
- host name, do not use ```ec-gitlab....com```, use ip address instead ```104.155......```, like the ssh link in repo. 
- the default key path is WRONG, key is not in ```config``` folder, make sure the key path is correct.
-  ```Unsupported option "rsaauthentication"``` check [here](https://blog.longwin.com.tw/2021/03/linux-ssh-config-unsupported-rsaauthentication-2021/), change the line ```RSAAuthentication yes``` to ```PubkeyAuthentication yes```.
**w/o setting the ```PubkeyAuthentication yes```, the ssh works fine, justing showing that ```Unsupported option "rsaauthentication"```**

### error looks like
```
$ git pull upstream master
/Users/.../.ssh/config line 3: Unsupported option "rsaauthentication"
git@104.155.....: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```
- after fixing the host name and file path, it's ok.


## remove the ```known_hosts``` file after changing setting
- once you use a new SSH connection, the setting is stored in ```known_hosts```, so remove it after editing settings.
